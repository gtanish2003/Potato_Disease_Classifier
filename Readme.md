# Potato Disease Classifier


Dataset : [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify diseases in potato plants. It's designed as a multiclassification system, capable of identifying multiple types of potato diseases from input images.

## Features

- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify potato diseases from images.

- Achieved 99% accuracy on the validation set by leveraging techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout.

## Technology Used
* Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Image Classification
* Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
* CNN Model Development
* Flask
* Model Deployment
